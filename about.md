My name is Wis Kojohnjaratkul. I'm currently an undergraduate student studying computer science at the University of California, San Diego. I find ML stuff pretty interesting so I'm just trying to ride along this big data + deep learning wave for now and see where it leads me. Apparently I also try to write blog posts now too so that's pretty neat.
